# Water_Jug
One of the most significant Python puzzles is the Water Jug Problem. The "water jug dilemma" is a situation where we have two jugs, one measuring "i" litres and the other "j" litres (0 < I < j). Since neither jug has markings for measuring little amounts, they will both start off empty. We must now use these two jugs to measure d litres of water where d j. To measure little amounts using the two jars, we do the following three operations:
```
💧🍶 Water Jug
├── Empty a Jug.
├── Fill a Jug
└── We pour the water of one jug into another one until one of them is either full or empty.
```
